#### Overview
HomeBoss is a powerful desktop application designed specifically for home-based business owners, offering

leveraging a Command Line Interface (CLI) for swift command execution, but it also features an 
elegant Graphical User Interface (GUI) that presents your data in a more refined and organized fashion.
